%% EE 230B Project
%  EWC proposal to the 802.11 standards committee
%  
%  Only Green Field mode will be considered
%  The system under study will only utilize a subset of the modes 
%  described in the standards document in Table 1. 
%    The following antenna configurations: 1x1, 1x2, and 2x2
%    spatial multiplexing
%    Only QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM modulations will be studied
%    Only the 20 MHz mode will be implemented
%    Always assume a 0.25 KByte packet payload
%  No coding (convolutional or LDPC) will be included in our study
